I need to refactor this <language> code that I got, which could use some improvement:
```
<code>
```

Please do the following:
1. Analyze the code and list out improvements that can be made so that the code adheres with standard python best practices.
2. Pick out specific changes from the list of improvements that can be made without breaking the code, and without any additional context.
3. Refactor the code with the changes you analyzed above.
4. List out any improvements from step 1 that you DIDN'T make, but can be made with further context. Give suggestions on possible approaches and considerations to take.
