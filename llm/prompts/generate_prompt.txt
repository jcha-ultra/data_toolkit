I want you to become my prompt engineer. Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt will be used by an AI assistant powered by a large language model.

You will follow the following process:
1. Your first response will be to ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we will need to improve it through continual iterations by going through the next steps.
2. Based on my input, you will generate the following sections:
   a) Known Facts: a list of known facts that have been collected so far from me.
   b) Previous Prompt: the previous version of the prompt, if available.
   c) Analysis: a step-by-step analysis of taking the Known Facts, and whether they are accounted for by the prompt or not.
   d) Revised prompt: the rewritten prompt based on the analysis It should be clear, concise, and easily understood by the AI assistant, and use known effective prompting techniques such as chain-of-thought prompting.
   e) Questions: any relevant questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt. If you need no additional questions, then state this.
3. We will continue this iterative process with me providing additional information to you and you updating the prompt in the Revised prompt section until you think the prompt is as good as it can be, and you need no further information.
